 <h3>intro</h3>
 <p>Daifukumochi (大福餅), or Daifuku (大福) (literally "great luck"), is a Japanese confection consisting of a small round mochi (glutinous rice cake) stuffed with sweet filling, most commonly anko, sweetened red bean paste made from azuki beans.Daifuku comes in many varieties.</p>
 <p>The most common is white-, pale green-, or pale pink-colored mochi filled with anko. These come in two sizes, one approximately 3cm (1.2in) diameter, the other palm-sized.Nearly all daifuku are covered in a fine layer of corn or potato starch to keep them from sticking to each other, or to the fingers.</p>

 <h3>History</h3>
 <p>Daifuku was originally called Habutai mochi (腹太餅) (belly thick rice cake) because of its filling's nature. Later, the name was changed to Daifuku mochi (大腹餅) (big belly rice cake). </p>
 <p>Since the pronunciations of Fuku (腹) (belly) and Fuku (福) (luck) are the same in Japanese, the name was further changed to Daifuku mochi (大福餅) (great luck rice cake), a bringer of good luck. By the end of the 18th century, Daifuku were gaining popularity and people began eating them toasted. They were also used for gifts in ceremonial occasions.</p>
